# PROJECT-9-ABND-HABIT-TRACKER-APP
The goal is to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time.
This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.

CONCEPTS COVERED:

1.Creating a SQLite table in your app

2.Populating that table with new entries

3.Modifying the entries

4.Displaying the contents of the table to users.
